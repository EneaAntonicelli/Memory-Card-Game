## Memory-Game

### Overview

This project is built using the React JavaScript library.

#### Instructions for gameplay:

The application renders 18 different images on the screen.

Each time the user clicks on an image, the pictures are shuffled. The task for the user is to click on each image once and only once. An array of clicked images is kept with a maximum count of 5; meaning, you cannot click the same image as any of the images you clicked in the last 5 rounds. This keeps the game going so as to allow for a very high, high score.

The application keeps track of the users High Score, and updates it when the user achieves a new High Score
